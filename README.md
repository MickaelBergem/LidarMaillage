LidarMaillage
=============

School project for the "_Maillages et Applications_" course (_Meshings and uses_), at Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech.

This program takes an ASCII PLY file in input (typically a cloud of points generated by an airborne LIDAR) and produces a 3D mesh of the urban scene, before and after simplification of the mesh.

Usage
=====
    ./LidarMaillage path_to_file.ply size_of_grid minimum_number_of_edges

For instance, `LidarMaillage data.ply 150 10000` will produce two files with the mesh computed from data.ply, the second being simplified down to 10000 edges.

Installation
============

This program requires [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), and Boost.

Just type the following :

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .
make
./LidarMaillage
```
